# go-port-scan
A simple port scanner written in go. 

My first goal is to be establishing a TCP connection with a go program.
Then I will extend that over multiple ports and allow user input to determine what ports to scan.
Finally I want to use concurrency to make it faster.  

I am going into this project knowing that nmap does all of this and does it to a much greater degree, but this porject will help me to understand what is going on at fundmental level.
