# go-port-scan
A simple port scanner written in Go. 

My first goal is to be able to establish a TCP connection with a Go program. Completed on (11-21-24)
Then, I will extend that over multiple ports and allow user input to determine which ports to scan.(11-26-24)
Finally, I want to use concurrency to make it faster.(11-26-24)  

I am going into this project knowing that nmap does all of this and does it to a much greater degree, but this project will help me to understand what is going on at fundmental level.
