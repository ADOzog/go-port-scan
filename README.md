# go-port-scan
A simple port scanner written in Go. 

My first goal is to be able to establish a TCP connection with a Go program. Completed on (11-21-24)
Then, I will extend that over multiple ports and allow user input to determine which ports to scan.(11-26-24)
Finally, I want to use concurrency to make it faster.(11-26-24)

Added Scan All fucntion (12-1-24)

I am going into this project knowing that nmap does all of this and does it to a much greater degree, but this project will help me to understand what is going on at fundmental level.


Adding some kind of database with this would help the user with the information they receive. I will have to see how I implement this feature.
